• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

A gitignore file contains types of files to be ignored by git while checking for untracked. This is done to avoid annoying prompts from git about files that are never going to get pushed / commit to the repo.
For a java project, the gitignore file should include  :
*.class
*.log
*.ctxt
.mtj.tmp/
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar
hs_err_pid*


• What does fast-forward in Git mean? 

When we try to merge a commit with another, if the branch on which the merge 
is being made hasn't diverged or changed, then git, instead of creating a new commit, 
moves the base branch pointer to the new commit. This is called Fast-Forward in git as there is no merge and commit.


• Why should you have different branches? 

We keep different branches in git for working on different user stories or in case of bug fixing. We can also have different branches in case we have more than one developer working on a code base.



• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Usually we will have only 1 remote git repository. There may be some cases in which having more are required/ideal.
